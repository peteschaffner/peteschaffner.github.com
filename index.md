# Hi, I’m Pete—

an American software designer based in Paris, France. I’m passionate about Apple platforms, native software, the view-source web and learning by doing. Away from the computer I’m a husband, a father and a lover of the wild.

Professionally, I work at Google on [Chrome for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823?mt=8). I also recently took over the macOS app, [Espresso](https://espressoapp.com) (though I am currently trying to find a new home for it—you can read more about why [here](https://espressoapp.com/blog/espresso-for-sale/)).

I'm generally an open book, so please feel free to reach out. I'm available on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/peteschaffner), [GitHub](https://github.com/peteschaffner) and via [email](mailto:peteschaffner@icloud.com).
