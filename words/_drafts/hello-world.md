title: Hello World

Hi, [I'm Pete](/) and this is my little corner of the internet. Today marks the first day of its existence—I hope there are many more to come.

This is kinda new to me: writing my words down and putting them out on the world wide web. I've always been very much in my head though, so I thought it might help to start getting some of it out now and again. <!--I guess I'm also hoping to find some clarity through writing.-->

And on the subject of writing, [Tim Smith has three rules](https://brightpixels.blog/hello) he follows. I like them so I'm going to use them too:

> 1. I’ll write whenever I feel like it, and won’t worry if it’s not perfect
  2. I will not look at stats of any kind
  3. I will write because it’s fun and has a personal archival purpose, not because I want recognition or validation

Other than to write, there is a second reason this site exists: it is a creative outlet for me. I love to tweak its design, tech, you-name-it. If you are curious about how it is designed and/or made, check out the [colophon](/colophon).

xoxo,  
Pete
