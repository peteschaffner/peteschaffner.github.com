Being able to peak under the hood, tinker and figure out how it all worked was what got me started as a developer. Come to think of it, it is still how I learn and work. I'm afraid we might be losing some of that on the web, however.

Brent Simmons put it nicely when he said:

I guess part of this over-complication and inadvertent obfuscation comes from the fact that we are pushing the web to—and maybe beyond—its limits (I'm looking at you “web apps”).

I just hope that there are still websites out there with clean markup, sane stylesheets and intelligible JavaScript. My web development depends on it.
